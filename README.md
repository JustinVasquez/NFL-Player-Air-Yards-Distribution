Plotting Air Yard Distributions for top 4 receivers per team

I recreated Sam Hoppen's (linked in the notebook) Player Air Yards Distribution graphic from Twitter, as of Week 2 of the 2023 NFL season. 
Save for some minor differences on the plots, I was able to recreate the essence of the original graphic.
The major aspect I was not able to copy is the grid format Sam's plots are laid out in. I reached out to Sam for help on this but he codes in R and was unsure of how to do so in Python. 
(If anyone has any guidance on how to do this, I would appreciate the help for future reference)

Quick insights:
* Colts giving Anthony Richardson, and Gardner Minshew after Richardson's exit in week 2, short throws to help them get comfortable
* Darius Slayton emerging as the Giants' deep threat through two weeks
* Rookie Zay Flowers getting some deep passes, but Ravens are primarily using him in the short/screen game
* Raschaad White is not getting many looks down field for Tampa, with the bulk of his targets coming behind the line of scrimmage, and none farther than about 7 yards past the LOS
